Hi! I’m Da-En Yu (尤大恩), a **software engineer specializing in machine learning, computer vision, and computer graphics, with additional experience in fullstack web and mobile application development**.

Before pursuing my graduate studies, I worked as a **semiconductor engineer in wafer-level chip packaging and testing**, where I built a strong foundation in disciplined engineering, cross-team collaboration, and solving problems under real production constraints.

I bring that same mindset to software engineering, with designing reliable systems, writing clean and maintainable code, and continuously learning new technologies. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me tuning cars or watching movies.

I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from Northeastern University and my B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech, NTUST).
